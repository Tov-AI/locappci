# Decisions log

One line per decision, newest first. Why we chose it matters more than what.

| Date | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-24 | Bottom sheet built on React Native `Modal` + `Animated`, no extra library | Works in Expo Go today; swipe-to-close can be added later with gesture-handler |
| 2026-10-24 | Components catalogue screen at `/composants`, linked from Compte in development only | Lets us review every component on a real phone before screens use them |
| 2026-10-24 | JavaScript tabs (`Tabs` from expo-router), not native tabs | Matches the designed white tab bar with labels and badges on both platforms |
| 2026-10-24 | DM Sans as the app font | Stand-in until the brand font is confirmed (open question) |
| 2026-10-24 | Brand colours measured from the logo: navy #002366, orange #F86200, green #00A032 | No official colour codes yet |
| 2026-10-24 | Feather icons from `@expo/vector-icons` | Bundled with Expo Go, consistent stroke style |
| 2026-10-24 | Build v1 against mock data first | Client access and plugin answers are pending; the API contract keeps the switch to real data small |
